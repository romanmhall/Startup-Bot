I wanted to test functions of automation in a video game that I like particular bonuses for characters at the start of a game. Also, the reason the scripts saved all results is I would like to see how high of a percentage bonus you can get when combining all 'Household' traits together. So far I have not seen over 60% but in theory 120% is possible, but likely not probable. The script is meant to look until a threshold is met so this can be ran until that day comes.
